This patch updates slirp-1.0.16
(Bug fixes)

It includes (modified) patches from Tim Watt, which corrects issues with
the checking of TTYs, and compilation of the FULL_BOLT version.

It also adds the "malloc heap corruption
patch" from Juergen Keil at the QEMU project (Kindly brought to my
attention by Gertjan Halkes)

The version number is updated to 1.0.17

Notes:

Under Cygwin using gcc 3.4.4 it was found that slirp wouldn't work with
the -O2 option enabled. This was eventually tracked down to tcp_input.c
which has issues with strict aliasing.

To work around this, I currently (manually) add a -fno-strict-aliasing
option to the COMMON_DEFS definition in the Makefile.
